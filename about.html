            <h1 class="main-heading">About Me</h1>
            <p class="intro-text">
                I am a graduate of M.Phil Music and Media Technology student in Trinity College Dublin, and currently studying my second postgraduate programme in M.Sc Interactive Digital Media also in Trinity College Dublin.
                My work explores the intersection of sound, modern technology, and experience design on
                how music, storytelling, and media interaction can create emotional and memorable moments using media technology.
                <br><br>
                I enjoy taking ideas from concept to completion, whether composing and producing
                sound, developing interactive media, or designing audiovisual experiences.
                I also work in the field of developing games for Brain Computer Interface using duo hybrid brain-wave systems.
                <br><br>
                I’m comfortable bridging artistic vision and technical execution, ensuring
                creativity meets precision. In both academic projects and community work,
                I’ve often been the person who connects people, plans structure, and makes sure
                “the vision actually happens” when it is needed.
