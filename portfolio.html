                <p>
                    An interactive audiovisual system combining traditional Chinese ink-wash
                    painting aesthetics, Blue-and-White Porcelain colour language, and live
                    music performance. The system uses Processing to generate fluid, ink-like
                    visuals and MaxMSP to capture MIDI performance from GuZheng-inspired
                    sounds. Real-time OSC communication links sound gestures to digital
                    “brush strokes,” allowing sound to paint. The work explores Taoist
                    Yin–Yang ideas and Pomo (泼墨) spontaneity, treating sound as the brush
                    and the screen as living ink.

                <h2>Circlet</h2>
                <p>
                    A visual music composition created in Adobe After Effects, inspired by
                    Sun Wukong’s golden circlet from <em>Journey to the West</em>. The piece
                    translates the tension between control and freedom into rhythm, motion,
                    and colour. Red and yellow dominate the palette, reflecting spiritual
                    pressure, rebellion, and inner energy. The work draws on traditions of
                    abstract visual music (McLaren, Fischinger, Kandinsky), using geometric
                    repetition and synchronised timing to connect musical development and
                    visual transformation.

                <h2>Be Water</h2>
                <p>
                    A spatial audio composition for 7.1 surround and binaural playback.
                    The piece treats spatialisation itself as a musical parameter: motion,
                    placement, and perspective shifts in the sound field become part of the
                    composition. The work blends first-order and second-order Ambisonics,
                    studio recordings, and electronic material, produced and mixed in
                    Reaper. Conceptually it follows Bruce Lee’s “be water” philosophy –
                    moving between force and softness, structure and fluidity.

                <h2>The Spirit Land</h2>
                <p>
                    A first-person brain–computer interface (BCI) game built in Unity that is
                    controlled by the player’s mental state in real time. The system uses
                    non-invasive EEG (OpenBCI Cyton + OpenBCI GUI) to read two different
                    brainwave conditions: focused mental effort (beta activity) and relaxed
                    state. In the game, concentration drives walking (“Beta Walk”), while
                    calmness triggers environmental events such as summoning a fish,
                    releasing a butterfly, or revealing a bridge. The landscape, lighting, and
                    music are designed as a night-time natural world to encourage immersion
                    and to guide the player toward these mental states. The project explores
                    how neural input can become a core interaction mode for immersive
                    environments, and is designed with future VR adaptation in mind.
